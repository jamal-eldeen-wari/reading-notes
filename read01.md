# Reading-Note

## Markdown Syntax:
it is a way of styling your words on your website, where it allows you to change the formats of your own words for instance making your words bold or even italic.
It also allows you to add images and creating lists (ordered or unordered). making your text look different by using some **basic non-alphabetical** characters to change their style.

## Github Pages: 
It allows us to change Github repositories into a cool looking websites where you can share almost anything such as:
* *Documentation* 
* And *projects* make them online.
### The Main Advantages of using GitHub pages is that :
1. There is no need for a Database Setup, Server Configuration, and HTML knowledge.
2. If you do not know anything about programming, you just want your content to be online, then GitHub pages will allow you to focus on your content rather than distribute it over the internet.
